## Part 1: Introduction to Google Colab

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) is a cloud-based notebook environment that allows you to write and run Python code without installing anything on your computer.

### **How to use Google Colab**
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
2. Click **File > New Notebook** to create a new Python notebook.
3. Each notebook consists of two types of cells:
   - **Code Cells**: Where you write Python code.
   - **Text Cells**: Used for explanations (written in Markdown).

### **Basic Python Execution in Google Colab**
```python
# This is a simple Python program
print("Hello, World!")
